> "If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his true friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the greatest highroad to his reason, and which when once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if, indeed, that cause be really a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his judgment, or to command his action, or to make him as one to be shunned or despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel and sharper than steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than Herculean force and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw." -Abraham Lincoln



After learning yesterday of Joe Biden's victory over Donald Trump, friends and I gathered around the television to watch the President-elect's speech. I'll admit to being a little taken in by Biden at the time - not for anything I could attribute to oratorial gifts - but because of how refreshing it was to hear their President speak coherently and with kindness again. 

Also noteworthy were those in the crowd, watching on. Supporters in his native Delaware had assembled in their cars due to coronavirus concerns, but had soon unburdened themselves of any fears and stood outside or on the tops of their SUVs, waving flags and placards and honking horns, and for a moment I was struck by how similar to Republican rallies this Democratic one appeared. "Yeah," my friend pointed out, "they're American". I was for a moment aware of my own partiality.

It's no small thing confronting one's own bias. Reading Bob Woodward's authoritative books, _Fear_ and _Rage_, these past few weeks illustrated the importance of it on a few  occasions. While the assertions made in them (and the wider media) about Trump's character and political abilities cannot be reasonably disputed, I can now - with numerous qualifiers - say at least one half-decent thing about him, and can also level criticism at some of his opponents. 

At this point I feel compelled to reiterate - _strongly_ - that I do not like Donald Trump or the Republican Party. He is a repugnant, corrupt and childish individual whose misdeeds are innumerable, who has damaged the highest office in his country, perhaps forever redirecting modern politics down a far more treacherous path. And the party itself is, as Noam Chomsky has said, "probably the most dangerous organization in the history of the world."

However, I admit after reading Woodward's account, I gained a modicum of appreciation for Trump's willingness to question commonly-held political doctrine. Or more specifically in this case, why it is that American military presence around the world is a universally accepted good. He questioned the unequal contribution by NATO signatories to its fund, why the United States continues its presence in South Korea, and why the US persists in its battles in the Middle East. As a proponent of leftist politics, these are questions for which I also long sought answers.

Now, none of this of course exempts him from deserved criticism when he would subsequently refuse all expert explanations and proceed obstinately onward, as was the case when he ignored advice from his generals, pulled out of the Turkey/Syria border, leaving thousands of Kurds to be slaughtered by Erdogan, and ISIS prisoners to escape. 

Nor am I willing to regard him with anything resembling a Socratic reverence; his  proximity to philosopical thought is comparable to my physical distance here in Melbourne, Australia, to Washington DC. And by many accounts he operates on a driving economic principle of simply not wanting to spend money. 

I will concede there might exist in him a desire to not see American troops dying in war, and there is evidence to suggest he expressed sorrow when confronted with the caskets of returned soldiers, going so far as to exaggerate the fallen's accomplishments to assuage the grief of their families. Again, though, like with everything Trumpian, it's a murky water one must look through to perceive anything real or true. We know he has repeatedly referred to prisoners of war as losers, and he doesn't appear to understand the value of self-sacrifice or non-transactional relationships. 

Media outlets, on the other hand, occasionally fanned flames that might best have been ignored, and often ensnared themselves in self-defeating patterns, covering mistakes and missteps that in any other period may have gone ignored. James Comey, too, was not without fault, coupling credible evidence of election interference with a scandalous dossier involving sex in a Russian hotel, leaving him (Comey) looking less like an intelligence ally and more like a J. Edgar Hoover disciple. 

This isn't - I feel the need to stress - to minimise #45's terrible presidency, but an old man carefully descending a walkway is not newsworthy, and nor are hotel escapades, no matter how sordid. If Trump has shown us anything, it's that the media certainly isn't going to look away, and so we must, when appropriate, do so instead. I wont take the high road and deny laughing - often in the presence of some of his fans - at Trump's expense, or indeed any of those in power caught with their hands in the jar. It's also important for me to acknowledge and remember that by my doing so, I never once converted any of them to my cause.

In an age of increasingly widespread nationalism and wild conspiracy, it is incumbent upon all - not just those in the United States - to at least be willing to look inwards and acknowledge weakness and fault, and learn from the damning lessons of the past four years, because he didn't seize power. People voted him into it. It is incredibly difficult, but by making these concessions we don't dispel or normalise the malevolent actions of world leaders or those who enable them, but instead endear ourselves to those we disagree with so that they might be more amenable to reason, more willing to listen to opinion that conflicts with their own firmly held beliefs, and less likely to vote for snakeoil salesmen and those who serve for their own personal gain.
